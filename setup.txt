FreeNAS Prep
1. SAS IT Flash 
	To flash the LSI 2308 into IT mode I used the following firmware:
	ftp://ftp.supermicro.com/Driver/SAS/LSI/2308/Firmware/IT/

	First you need to get the LSI SAS address.
	Restart the board; when you see the LSI prompt: "LSI Corporation ... "
	Press Control-C on the keyboard (I did it all via IPMI), press Ctrl-C successively until you see "starting configuration utility" because it's quite easy to miss

	Once you're in there, press Enter this will show the SAS address
	it looks like:

	500304800:70a8b00

	You need the last 9 digits: so here that would be: 0070a8b00

	The DOS instructions do *NOT* work on this board, you must use the UEFI method.
	I disconnected all the disks connected to the LSI out of habit for any flashing. Not sure that's required, but I did it just to be safe.

	Format a USB stick in FAT32; copy the content of the UEFI folder unto it
	The restart the X10SL7-F, press F11 when prompted and select the built-in UEFI option.

	Once you're on the UEFI prompt, mount the disk. The list of available disk volume will be shown on the screen:
	for me it was fs1, so mount it:

		mount fs1:

	Then I selected that device:

		fs1:

	follow the instruction in the SMC2308IT_FW_Flash_Instruction_091012 file:

	run SMC2308T.nsh (if you've copied the UEFI folder and not its content from the archive above, do

		cd UEFI

	first)

		SMC2308T.nsh

	The goes on for a little while, and right at the end you're prompted for the 9 digits, enter them and press ENTER.

	Reboot... that's it... the card is in IT mode now.
	----

	XHCI had to be disabled otherwise FreeNAS wouldn't boot, it refused to mount the root partition, this is done in the BIOS:
	Advanced -> PCH-IO Configuration. XHCI Mode has to be set to Disabled

	Note to anyone: Do *NOT* enable the watchdog, that only makes your machine reboot after 5 minutes, I had set it without realising and I thought I had a faulty boards for a short while...

FreeNAS Setup
1. Install
	-Download latest image
	-Extract img and burn to usb using Win32DiskImager
	-Put USB into Server and boot from USB
	-Everything should load and a IP address should be showen, navigate using any browser to that IP
	
2. LAGG setup
	-Delete all interface configs
	-Under "Network → Link Aggregations → Create Link Aggregation"
	-Select LACP and highlight the interefaces you want added to the LAGG, Press OK
	-highlight the created LAGG and click edit, then go ahead and edit the NEtwork settings for the LAGG
	-Restart the Server and use the new address to access the GUI
	
3. Creating Zpool / adding Vdev
	-Under Storage → Volumes → ZFS Volume Manager
	-Choose Volume Name or Volume to expand
	-Choose your Raid format and Select you disks
		10x2TB WD REDs
			Name:		All
			Encryption:	No
			Raid:		RaidZ2

4. setting up permissions
	-select account
	-lookup groups and users on excel sheet and create them accordingly
	-apply permissions to datasets according to the excel sheet

5. Create ZFS Dataset
	-Select exisiting ZFS volume/Dataset → Create ZFS Dataset
	-Choose Name, Compression Level and Quota
		See Excel Sheet for Dataset Config
	
6. Creating Shares
	-see excel document for share configs
	-You have to go to services, CIFS and add the 2 following lines to the Auxiliary Parameters text field:
	-ea support = no
	-store dos attributes = no
	
7. Settting up email alerts
	-Under Account → Users → View Users
	-Click the ChangeE-mail and input details
		From email: root@freenas.local
		Outgoing mail server: smtp.gmail.com
		Port to connect to: 465 (for SSL)
		TSL/SSL: SSL
		Use SMTP Authentication: (checked)
		Username: **************@gmail.com
		Password: **************

7.1 Creating SMART HDD Email alerts
	-Once Email is setup SSH in as root
	-Type the following
		mount -wu /
		cd /conf/base/etc
		ee esmart.sh
	-Code to put in file
		{
			#!/usr/local/bin/sh
			#
			# Place this in /conf/base/etc/
			# Call: sh esmart.sh
			(
			echo "To: YourEmail@Address.net"
			echo "Subject: SMART Drive Results for all drives"
			echo " "
			) > /var/cover
			#HDD 1
			smartctl -i -H -A -n standby -l error /dev/ada0 >> /var/cover
			#HDD 2
			smartctl -i -H -A -n standby -l error /dev/ada1 >> /var/cover
			#HDD 3
			smartctl -i -H -A -n standby -l error /dev/ada2 >> /var/cover
			#HDD 4
			smartctl -i -H -A -n standby -l error /dev/ada3 >> /var/cover
			sendmail -t < /var/cover
			exit 0
			 
			# Set idle mode to so it doesn't spin up.
			# Options -n standby
			# -i = Device Info
			# -H = Device Health
			# -A = Only Vendor specific SMART attributes
			# -l error = SMART Error Log
		}
	-Press ESC and save file
	-run it to test
		sh esmart.sh
	-Write so there on reboot
		cd /etc
		cp /conf/base/etc/esmart.sh .
	-Create the Cron Job
		User: root
		Command: sh /etc/esmart.sh
		Description: HDD SMART Results

7.2 Check temps on fly
	-ssh in as root
	-create file etemps.sh
		ee etemps.sh
		{
			#!/usr/local/bin/sh
			#
			# Place this in /conf/base/etc/
			# Call: sh etemps.sh
			(
			echo "To: bbbiiittt1198@gmail.com"
			echo "Subject: SMART Drive Temps for all drives"
			echo " "
			echo "CPU temp :"
			) > /var/cover
			sysctl -a |egrep -E "cpu\.[0-9]+\.temp" >> /var/cover
			(
			echo
			echo "HDD temp :"
			) >> /var/cover
			for i in $(sysctl -n kern.disks)
			do
			DevTemp=`smartctl -a /dev/$i | awk '/Temperature_Celsius/{print $0}' | awk '{pri
			DevSerNum=`smartctl -a /dev/$i | awk '/Serial Number:/{print $0}' | awk '{print
			DevName=`smartctl -a /dev/$i | awk '/Device Model:/{print $0}' | awk '{print $3}
			echo $i $DevTemp $DevSerNum $DevName >> /var/cover
			done
			sendmail -t < /var/cover
			exit 0
		}
	-run file
		sh etemps.sh
	-Write so there on reboot
		cd /etc
		cp /conf/base/etc/etemps.sh .

		User: root
		Command: sh /etc/etemps.sh
		Description: HDD Temps


8. Move Data
